"""
engine/detectors.py
Detects specific, well-known PII fields (Aadhaar, PAN, DOB, phone, email,
card numbers, address, names) plus a generic "any Label: Value" detector
that catches fields the specific detectors don't know about (Father's
Name, Account Number, IFSC Code, Policy No, ...). Every detector returns
a list of `instance` dicts with a common shape so the pipeline can treat
them uniformly.
